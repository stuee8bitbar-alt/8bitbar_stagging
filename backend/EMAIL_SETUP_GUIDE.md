# üìß Email Configuration Guide for 8BitBar

## Current Issue

The SMTP server `smtp.8bitbar.com.au` is not resolving (DNS error). This needs to be configured with your hosting provider.

## Quick Solutions

### Option 1: Configure 8BitBar SMTP Server

Contact your hosting provider (where 8bitbar.com.au is hosted) to:

1. Set up SMTP service for `smtp.8bitbar.com.au`
2. Configure MX records and SMTP authentication
3. Verify the correct SMTP settings

### Option 2: Use Gmail SMTP (Temporary Solution)

1. Create a Gmail account for 8BitBar (e.g., `8bitbar.gaming@gmail.com`)
2. Enable 2-factor authentication
3. Generate an App Password for SMTP
4. Update `.env` file:

```env
GMAIL_USER=8bitbar.gaming@gmail.com
GMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
```

### Option 3: Use Alternative SMTP Service

Consider using services like:

- **SendGrid** (recommended for business)
- **Mailgun**
- **Amazon SES**
- **Postmark**

## Environment Variables Setup

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```env
# Email Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.8bitbar.com.au
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_SECURE=true
SMTP_USER=orders@8bitbar.com.au
SMTP_PASS=your-actual-password

# Alternative SMTP service can be configured here if needed
```

## Testing Email Configuration

1. The system will automatically test the SMTP connection
2. Check server logs for connection status:
   - ‚úÖ = Connection successful
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è = Connection failed, using fallback
   - ‚ùå = All connections failed

3. **Connection Timeout**: Firewall or port blocking

### Solutions:

1. Verify SMTP server exists and is accessible
2. Check credentials with hosting provider
3. Test with alternative SMTP service
4. Check firewall settings
